(require 'magit-popup)

;; This "previous popup" functionality is hardcoded in
;; 'magit-invoke-popup-action' to handle "q" key, but I want to bind it
;; to another key.  I didn't make a pull request to add
;; 'magit-popup-previous-or-quit' and to bind it to "q" in
;; 'magit-popup-mode-map' because it would be undesired, if I understood
;; it right from the commit message of
;; <https://github.com/magit/magit/commit/2ef07e3aa01b19b68e348ee4c4ed9e3428ef4e1e>.
