;;; Commentary:

;; I don't like `transient' behavior: it heavily uses minibuffer hooks,
;; pre/post-command hooks, and `overriding-terminal-local-map'.  All
;; this makes impossible to use any key binding when transient is in
;; progress.  You cannot even `edebug' it as it prevents any
;; "non-transient activity".  So this file provides the code to "fix"
;; transient by transforming it into a normal popup buffer with normal
;; major mode and normal keymap.
